<h1 align="center">GreetingsðŸ‘‹, I'm Milton Lindao</h1>
<h3 align="center">Dynamics 365 F&O Tech Consultant | Azure LCS | Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations</h3>

I'm an IT professional specialized in Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O, AX, and NAV solutions, with over 10 years of experience leading high-volume implementations, migrations, and integrations for companies across LATAM and Europe.

I focus on delivering direct business value through pragmatic and sustainable solutions, even in complex or transitional environments. I leverage and extend the ERP's capabilities (finance, logistics, projects, manufacturing) and integrate it with the broader corporate application ecosystem. This includes developing mobile, web, and desktop solutions (.NET, SQL Server, Java, Oracle, Android) that interact via OData, APIs, Power Platform, and CI/CD automation for continuous deployment.

I'm also certified in Scrum and Agile methodologies, which enables me to lead and collaborate with multidisciplinary teams focused on quality and innovation.

I'm passionate about contributing to projects with strong technical execution, clear communication, and professional autonomyâ€”while actively pursuing formal certifications and fluency in English.
